# SplineEditor

A Roblox Studio plugin to generate piecewise functions in Lua(u) from creating and editing splines visually.

## What is a spline?
A spline is a curve connecting two points. They are useful for determining the y-value at specified x-values.

### Why SplineEditor?
After attempting to remake Minecraft, I learned that Mojang overlays splines ontop of noise for control over the appearance of the terrain. Unfortunately I couldn't find any tools that could create splines visually, so I resorted to manually solving and programming piecewise functions. This didn't suffice as many iterations of splines are needed.

This plugin solves the problem by intergrating right into Roblox Studio and generating Lua(u) code.
